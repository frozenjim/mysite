Django's classic beginner tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/) using PyCharm.

As I run through the tutoria, I will commit as I complete each of the lessons.  

Note:  I am completing both the Django Tutorial and the GitHub Commits using the PyCharm IDE from 
       JetBrains (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm).  I am leaving the PyCharm hidden .idea files 
       in the commits as they are useful to ensure all project devs are sharing the same settings 
       (assuming all devs are using PyCharm).

I am not sure WHY I want to do this, mostly to learn how the systems all work together - I suppose :-).
